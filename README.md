# Laser-Dot-Follower
The laser dot following car was built as a semester project for an embedded systems course at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The main goal of this project was to understand the uses and design processes of integrating an embedded system into a project.![5photo2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62693a79-118a-4cb3-a890-634ff124844f)


# System Design
The core of the project is based on the paper by Garc√≠a-Cardenas et al in IEEE Xplore ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220239)). The system comprises two DC motors with encoders and a servo motor arm. We set on using a simple color-space filtering algorithm paired with a simple motor voltage adjusting algorithm.
